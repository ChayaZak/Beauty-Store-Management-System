Point of Sale (POS) System for a Beauty and Aesthetics Store
This project is a Point of Sale (POS) system designed for a beauty and aesthetics store. 
The system streamlines sales and business management processes by providing comprehensive tools for managing products, customers, promotions, and orders.

Key Features:

Full CRUD operations for all entities (products, customers, promotions, and orders)
Developed in C# using a three-tier architecture (UI, logic, and data layers)
Data storage in XML files for easy backup, portability, and external editing
Two intuitive WinForms-based user interfaces:
Admin Interface: Full access to manage products, customers, and promotions (CRUD operations)
Cashier Interface: Dedicated for processing customer orders, with permissions to add and edit customers, but without access to modify products or promotions
Emphasis on object-oriented programming principles, proper data structure design, and maintainable, readable code
This POS system is tailored to the needs of retail businesses in the beauty and aesthetics sector, 
providing efficient management and a user-friendly experience for both administrators and cashiers.
