Point of Sale (POS) System for a Beauty and Aesthetics Store 

•	Developed a POS system for managing products, customers, promotions, and orders in a beauty and aesthetics store, aimed at streamlining sales and business management processes.

•	The system supports full CRUD operations for all entities, utilizing C# and a three-tier architecture to separate the interface, logic, and data layers.

•	 System data is stored in XML files, enabling external data storage, portability between different systems, simple backup, and convenient data editing when needed.

•	The system features two intuitive user interfaces based on WinForms: an admin interface that allows full CRUD operations on all entities (products, customers, and promotions), and a dedicated cashier interface designed for processing customer orders.

•	The project emphasizes object-oriented programming principles, proper data structure design, and writing clear and maintainable code.
